# python_youtube_scraper_selenium
Youtube Scraper with selenium (python)


This is the same project I had made with BeautifulSoup before but it is way better,

using IDs and NAMES and TAGs instead is way more stable than just using indexes of the js info tag

the only thing it is missing is the channel subscribers count wich is a challenge here aswell,

I might update it later and add this feature to it.


Also included some test samples made with this script in the github repository.


Hope you can use this and have fun!
